            <h2>Curriculum</h2>
            <p>
                BSc (180 ECTS credits) Once the scientific basics have been acquired (1st year), the curriculum offers general classes on electronics, circuits and systems, and signal processing. This training is complemented by practical work in laboratories and projects.
                During the final year of your undergraduate studies, you will choose two out of three areas which will make up the core of your training: micro and nanoelectronics, information technologies, and energy.

            </p>
            <p>
                Prospects: MSc Program During the MSc, you will specialize in one of the three areas. The micro and nanoelectronics area focuses, among other things, on circuit design, embedded systems, and real-time computing. With information technology, you will take
                advanced courses in signal processing, image recognition, sound processing, and optics. The energy area deals with the dynamics of networks and their optimization, power conversion, control electronics, mechatronics, and industrial electronics.
                The MSc’s curriculum is further complemented by projects and practical work. Finally, it should be noted that you can choose the “MNIS” (Micro & Nanotechnologies for Integrated Systems) MSc program that is jointly offered at EPFL, the
                Institut polytechnique de Grenoble, and the Politecnico di Torino.
